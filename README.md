Machine Teaching is a fancy input device to reduce an object to key components that code can interpret and translate to other programs. Inspired a bit by what we discussed in class regarding code that can be multipurpose and used by a lot of different people in different projects. 

The page takes input from the buttons and text fields and translates it into a JSON-formatted file that can be used as a base for other machines to learn from. I wanted to have it be manual because I was thinking about how people interact with machine learning systems and thought it would be cute to have something where the user can actually 'teach' the machine rather than simply leaving it to exract traits from examples on its own. 

I had to rescope this project several times due to constraints (things like "this can't be done without using an external library that is incompatible with github.io" were common) so there was a lot of learning curve regarding what javascript in-browser can and can't do as well as tempering my expectations. I thought a lot about what kind of interaction would be meaningful and different in the context of what was covered in class because the readings and discourse made me rethink a lot of how we make code and think about the code.

The HTML could definitely be prettier (mostly the fault of the rainbow buttons, which I was very attached to) but I think the javascript turned out well.
