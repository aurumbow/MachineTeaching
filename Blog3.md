As I was making progress on Machine Teaching I had to think about what the collected data would be used for and how to make it the most accessible to other programmers/programs as well as how to get it out of the object it was currently being stored in. Most learning machines store their information in a connected JSON file, and conveniently, javascript has a built in method called JSON.stringify() which converts an object or an array to a JSON-friendly string that can then be stored in local storage or elsewhere on the backend of the program. 

I did make use of JSON.stringify(), but the regular suggested usage of storing data on a local storage or somewhere in the back of the program felt counterintuitive to the use of the program, which was to create usable files relatively quickly. Basically, I didn't want users to have to sift through their browser console to find the collected data and then have to export it manually for their own use, I wanted the program to produce an easily downloadable file for the output. I remembered learning how to do something similar in Java back in high school and, assuming it couldn't be that much more complicated, looked up the syntax for writing to a downloadable JSON file in javascript. 

What I was met with were a lot of responses indicating the best way to do this, and in fact standard practice, was to use an add-on called Node.js - to the extent that people would suggest Node.js-specific syntax without specifying that was what they were doing, and even people specifically looking for suggestions that did not use Node were being told that they really should just use Node! The people seem totally infatuated and reliant on the Node.js tool, which in fairness did have a very clean system for reading and writing connected files, but had one major problem - it was incompatible with github pages, so as I wanted to host Machine Teaching on github pages, I could not use Node.js the way everyone else seemed to be! This was related to the same problem I had encountered in the other project, where the assumption was always that a programmer would be using Photon, so there was a dearth of resources available for other options, which completely discouraged me from attempting to recreate the project with another server tool. I do think it's a really big issue with coding that the community becomes so reliant on one tool that they fail to consider situations where that tool is not applicable for whatever reason. 

I did eventually bite the bullet and come up with the inelegant solution of having the program write the JSON-formatted strings to a .txt file rather than a JSON file, but I felt that having the user be able to download the file was the really important part of the project.
