After my first idea didn't work and was abandoned because I had spent more time looking into one bug than actually making progress, I obviously had to go back to the beginning and think of a new idea. This was not easier the second time around as I now had both a much tighter time restraint and a number of project ideas I decided to scrap because I felt they were too similar to the original idea and now felt derivative and like lazy backup plans instead of new unique ideas. So again I went through the course content and my own projects for inspiration. I found an old (unfinished) Machine Learning project from a previous year, which reminded me how much we talked about machine learning and AI, especially in the last weeks of the class. 

Something we didn't discuss that much in class that's an interest of mine was the anthropomorphization of machines; the tendency to treat them like people with independent  wills even though they aren't. The Merriam-Webster dictionary even has a quote from a 2021 Forbes article that reads "Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI" ! People do this a lot with all machines (Roomba vacuum cleaners and smarthome speakers especially) and I'm not totally immune, when my computer is taking a long time to process something I usually comment that "it's thinking about it" or "it's chewing on it" the same way I might about another person or an animal. Especially regarding machine learning I think this perception causes a lot of people to excuse some of the more problematic trends in the industry because "the machine simply doesn't know any better" without acknowledging that the machine was programmed and taught by people with biases and doesn't have the independent capacity to outgrow those biases on it's own. 

I wanted to explore the idea of anthropomorphizing an algorithm in a way that forced people to directly confront the fact that machine learning programs are created by humans. I did some poking around popular related projects on the internet such as akinator (which guesses a character, celebrity, or object based on user input answers) or ImageNet (which is intended to recognize images and correlate them with nouns within a database) but found that in use, they tend to mystify the process (especially akinator). Because I was interested in making something to demystify how these datasets are accumulated, I decided the best way would be to approach from a reverse angle and have the user be responsible for the input of data and use of that collected data once the program was finished.
